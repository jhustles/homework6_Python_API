# Weather Analysis Using Open Weather API

![ks_logo](images/intro_pic.jpg)


I always follow the weather. So one day, I dedicded to do create a Python script to analyze and visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have Python3 and Jupyter Notebook already installed on your computer, and will need to import the following libraries:
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* Json
* Requests
* Time
* Pprint (Pretty Print To Read JSON)
* OS
* CSV
* Open Weather Map API Key (https://openweathermap.org/api - Free)
  
## Getting Started

To only view my Python script and output of my analysis, please click on the "OpenWeatherMapAPI_Data Analysis.ipynb", and you will be able to view it on GitHub via your web broswer.

Otherwise, you will need to have all the prerequites installed, download / clone my repository, and open the "OpenWeatherMapAPI_Data Analysis.ipynb" file via Jupyter Notebook, and go to OpenWeatherMap.org/api to register for a free API key, as I have removed mine from the repository for security reasons.
